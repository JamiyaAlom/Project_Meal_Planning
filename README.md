# Meal Planning Optimisation Project
This project aims to generate optimal meal plans that balance cost and nutritional value, or both, using optimisation techniques. 

It includes:
Single-objective optimisation: minimising cost.
Multi-objective optimisation: balancing cost (minimising cost) and nutrition (e.g., maximizing protein).
