# Meal Planning Optimization Project
This project aims to generate optimal meal plans based on cost, nutritional value, or both using optimization techniques. 
It includes:
Single-objective optimization: minimizing cost.
Multi-objective optimization: balancing cost (Minimizing Cost) and nutrition (e.g., Maximizing protein).
